Purpose:

The purpose of this assginment is to implement prim MST algorithm and 
Dijkstra SSSP algorithm.

loadWgtGraph.c

minPQ.c

In graph04.c, the main function is used to call diferent functions to 
complete these two algorithms.
1.open a input file
2.read and parse the file 
3.build the graph 
4.print graph
5.implement these two algorithms
7.print out the result

edgeList.c defines ADT's member functions such as edgeFirst, edgeRest and
edgeCons.
edgeList.h remains the same according to the requirement.

In loadWgtGraph.h and loadWgtGraph.c, functions such as parseN, initEdges, 
loadEdges, printGraph are declared and defined to build the graph
according to the input file.

In minPQ.h and minPQ.c, ADT priority queue is declared and defined for 
implementation of our greedy algorithms.

In greedyTree.h and greedyTree.c, functions for implementation of greedy 
algorithms are defined. Functions initStatus, initFringeWgt and initParent, 
arrays are initialized for saving the data. Function printArrays can be
used to debug or print out the results. Function calcPriority is used to
calculate the priority in different ways depending on the argument 'task'.
Functions greedyTree and updateFringe are derived from the skeleton given
in our text book. They are modified a little bit to accomplish that it 
can implement two algorithms with one function.


compile:

make 

The Makefile is modified. So all object files and binary files we need
can be generated by this simple command.


usage:

./graph04 -P 1 primTest.in
          or
./graph04 -D 1 dijkstraTest.in


test files:

There are 2 test files. primTest.in is an undirected graph, and 
dijkstraTest.in is a directed graph. These two graphs are given as examples
in class.
