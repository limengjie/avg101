Purpose:

The purpose of this assginment is to implement SCC algorithm.


files:

scc03.c
intList.h
intList.c
loadGraph.h
loadGraph.c
ftStack.h
ftStack.c
dfsTrace1.h
dfsTrace1.c
dfsPhase2.h
dfsPhase2.c
Makefile
testFiles 

In scc03.c, the main function is used to call diferent functions to 
complete the scc algorithm.
1.open a input file
2.read and parse the file 
3.build the graph 
4.print graph
5.SCC phase 1
6.transpose graph
7.SCC phase 2

intList.c defines ADT's member functions such as intFirst, intRest and intCons.
intList.h remains the same according to the requirement.

In loadGraph.h and loadGraph.c, functions such as parseN, initEdges, 
loadEdges, printGraph, transposeGraph, hasCycle and hasCycleLen are 
declared and defined to build the graph according to the input file.

In ftStack.h and ftStack.c, stack functions such as initStk, isEmptyStk,
printStk, pushStk, topStk and popStk are use to manipulate the finish time
stack, an ADT created to store the finish time.

In dfsTrace1.h and dfsTrace1.c, functions are defined and declared to 
accomplish the first phase of scc algorithm. 
initColor(int), initDiscoverTime(int), initFinishTime(int) and
initParent(int) are used to initialize those arrays will be used in DFS.
Then call dfsSweep1 and dfsTrace1 to finish the DFS, fill the related 
arrays and push those vertices into stack based on their finish time.
The dfsSweep1 will return the finishStack for next scc phase.

In dfsPhase2.h and dfsPhase2.c, functions are declared and defined to 
accomplish the second phase of scc algorithm. 
initDfstRoot function is used to record the leaders of each scc.
Call dfsTsweep2 and dfsT2 to accomplish DFS according to the order in 
finish time stack and fill corresponding arrays.






compile:

make scc03 

The Makefile is modified. So all object files and binary files we need
can be generated by this simple command.


usage:

./scc03 testfile



test files:

There are 3 test files in testFiles directory. test.in is the given sample 
file. g711.in and g724.in are input files I made according to the graphs
7.11 and 7.24 in the textbook.
